# Reaper Angel Moog simulator settings  
This is designed for the M-Audio M-Track
you need that and a regular sound card for this to work.
First use pulse audio.
Cotrol the feeds so that each device is at its own station 
otherwise you'll get major feedback. 
Its easy to do just screw around with it a lot.
No special wire requried
just a USB cable
my advice? check out a reaper forum howto
***NO SPECIAL PLUGINS REQUIRED***
